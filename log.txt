Cloned ArduPilot repository on Google Code and published changes to
the repository.
Tried to give Erik permission to push to the repo but didn't get it to
work.
Changed arm/rearm motors control to roll control instead of yaw
control, since yaw is broken on our controller.
Tried to help Erik resurrect his computer after a strange crash where
nothing at all happened after POST.

Visited the reactor hall. Returned to the lab and tried to connect and
calibrate radio controller. Attempted to fly the quadrotor with radio
control, yaw control seems to be broken which made the quadrotor arm
the motors randomly. Discovered that failsafe seems to be to max the
throttle, investigated arduino code for the cause of this. The
failsafe seems to be to rise 10 m, but we did not give it the chance
to do that while testing.
