Tried flying some more. After flipping the coordinate axes so they
agreed, the behaviour improved dramatically. No longer did it just
take off in a random direction, but instead flew in outward spirals
around the target location. Spent most of the day trying to figure out
what was wrong. Disabling inertial navigation in the Z direction
improved altitude hold, but not by much.

Erik found an online ArduCopter simulator. When given the control
settings set on board the quad, even the simulation diverged much in
the same way as the real thing. Using the simulator we selected
parameters that seemed good and went out to try again. It worked like
a charm.

Many plastic pieces were consumed by a few crashes today.

We tried flying the quad in LOITER mode in Maskinparken. It behaved
very oddly. Later in the day we realised that navigation.pde and
inertia.pde have different coordinate systems and set out to change
this.

Started working with the Tmotes. Tried to compile and run a bunch of
Tmote code but couldn't make it work. Managed to install and run
TinyOS's SerialForwarder Java utility and wrote a Java program that ran
a handshake routine. That worked, but all attempts at compiling
applications for installation on the mote failed.

Incorporated inertial navigation into LOITER mode, and went outside to
test it. After a whole lot of confusion and frustration, managed to get
the quadrotor to fly. LOITER did not seem to hold position very well,
but I didn't let it fly very far either.

Tweaked inertial navigation parameters a bit, took the circuit for
another walk and did some more tests on inertial navigation. After all,
inertial navigation might actually improve the quadrotor's ability to
stabilize and hover at a given location. The test results this time did
indicate that inertial navigation gives a not-so-bad indication of small
scale movements.
Read a little about the Kalman filter.

Added inclusion of position data from external positioning system to
inertial navigation system. Took the circuit for a walk and analyzed the
results. The results did not quite indicate that inertial navigation
would improve the position estimate.

Added a test mode that prints lots of sensor data, and some processed
data as well.

Read a little more on the report.
Worked with inertial navigation: tried to implement a Kalman filter and
performed some tests by logging and plotting inertial data readings.

Wrote a test module that flashes the LEDs on the Arduino board.
Discussed Kalman filtering a lot with Erik.
Read the final report from EL2420, fall 2011.

Cloned ArduPilot repository on Google Code and published changes to
the repository.
Tried to give Erik permission to push to the repo but didn't get it to
work.
Changed arm/rearm motors control to roll control instead of yaw
control, since yaw is broken on our controller.
Tried to help Erik resurrect his computer after a strange crash where
nothing at all happened after POST.

Visited the reactor hall. Returned to the lab and tried to connect and
calibrate radio controller. Attempted to fly the quadrotor with radio
control, yaw control seems to be broken which made the quadrotor arm
the motors randomly. Discovered that failsafe seems to be to max the
throttle, investigated arduino code for the cause of this. The
failsafe seems to be to rise 10 m, but we did not give it the chance
to do that while testing.
